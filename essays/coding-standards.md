## My experience with learning coding standards

When I first started learning how to program, I was confused on why programmers used such funky looking words and off-looking capitalization. I'm pretty sure most people were. The language was technically English, but it's more like learning a whole other language than a dialect. However, as I started to grow more accustomed to learning what meant what, I started to appreciate the way that most words were abbreviated: Integer to int, Boolean to bool, and "list of things" to []. And in a coding standard fashion, I started learning how to capitalize everything so it makes sense.

A lot of my current skills came from trial and error during the development of my first game. It's a game I never published, because I had to constantly redo the code. Everytime I learned things like camelCase, or _local variable names, I thought, "That makes so much sense, I need to do that, otherwise my code will be unusuable!"

## Why is bad code bad?

There's one word that comes to mind from my experience coding: scalability. If you don't use proper coding standards, your program might work in a vaccum. However, take it outside of that, and put it into a project, and nothing will make sense. For example, a bad coding might fully capitalize all of their variables, like in a Player class they would have Health and Stamina variables. However, to someone who is looking through all of the variables in a public setting, they now have to take an extra unnecessary step to determine if what they are looking at is a class or a local variable.

The reason you want to learn how to follow coding standards is for the courtesy of others, and yourself by extension. Ease of use is always nice, right? There's always something more professional about a program that anyone can use, instead of the person who made it always having to sit by your side explaining what everything means. We want things to be as clear and concise as possible in the professional world, as we all have our own things to do.

I myself still have some coding standards to get used to (like the placement of curly braces according to ESLint), however, if you're ever planning on working with a team of people, learning coding standards would be a great way to get cordial with them fast.
