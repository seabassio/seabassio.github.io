## What is a smart question?

According to Eric Steven Raymond, in "How To Ask Questions the Smart Way", a smart question is one that is detailed, appropriate, and to the point. They are specific questions, with details like the operating system, the error code, the steps already taken to solve it, and the code causing the error in question. It is good practice to try everything you can to solve a problem before posting to a forum about it. 

To be appropriate, it also has to be in the right forum, and this not only includes the general idea of the forum, but also specific skill levels that the forum normally solves. If you post a question you could have solved by simply Googling a problem or reading the manual, you will most likely not get the answer you want. It is important to check if there has been any progress made on your question before, as it will save everyone time and effort.

To be to the point, the question just needs to be professional and polite. If you include too much detail like how you were up until 3 am downing whiskey trying to solve a problem, or you ask a question like, "Is anyone willing to help?", people will most likely ignore your question and instead focus on your ethics. A smart question would only incldue the information needed for people to find it on the forum, pick it up, and help you find a solution.


## Some examples of smart and not-so-smart questions

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1421862/metadata-file-dll-could-not-be-found) is an example I found of a smart question, according to Raymond.

I am working on a WPF, C# 3.0 project, and I get this error:

Error 1 Metadata file
'WORK=- \Tools\VersionManagementSystem\BusinessLogicLayer\bin\Debug
\BusinessLogicLayer.dll' could not be found C:\-=WORK=- \Tools
\VersionManagementSystem\VersionManagementSystem\CSC VersionManagementSystem
This is how I reference my usercontrols:

xmlns:vms="clr-namespace:VersionManagementSystem"
<vms:SignOffProjectListing Margin="5"/>
It happens after every failed build. The only way I can get the solution to compile is to comment-out all my user controls and re-build the project. Then I uncomment the usercontrols and everything is fine.

I have checked build orders and dependency configurations.

As you can see, it seems to have truncated the DLL file's absolute path... I have read that there is a bug with the length. Is this a possible problem?

It's very annoying and having to comment, build, and uncomment, the build is becoming extremely tiresome.
