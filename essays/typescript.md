## Learning TypeScript without knowing Javascript

Before my ICS 314 class, I did not know any Javascript. I had heard about it from other people in my earlier classes, but I had never experimented with it myself. Thankfully, because I have had to learn other languages like C, C#, and Java, learning the syntax of Javascript wasn't too hard for me. Learning TypeScript was actually easier than I thought after that, as it made more sense to me than Javascript. I am used to having to declare a type for every variable, so learning TypeScript was actually a fun and gratifying experience after that.

## What I think of TypeScript

I think TypeScript is a good language if you are looking to work in a collaborative setting, like in software engineering. It works better than Javascript for this because it enforces type-setting for variables. This way, if you are passing a function or a variable to another person working on the program, then they can see with a glance what exactly the value should be. This removes the ambiguity from functions that return values. From the perspective of a solo-coder, it might require a bit more work on the syntax side, but it is well worth it due to the scalability of the language. 

## My thoughts on athletic software engineering

Athletic software engineering is a concept I was recently introduced to, but I am all for it. Even though it is stressful at times, because I am used to having to go back and redo some work, I think it is a discipline worth learning. In an actual software development job, not only is accuracy a priority, but also speed. Employers will likely keep you hired longer if you are able to complete tasks quickly and effectively. They will have to pay you for less hours, have more confidence in giving you work, and you will be able to contract more work sooner. So, even though I am currently struggling on the matter, I do believe athletic software engineering is a very useful skill to learn, especially in the field of game development.

## I am excited to learn more about this language

Being an amateur game designer, getting the skills necessary to thrive in the field is very exciting. Since I don't have much time on my hands to be programming for long amounts of time at once, I will give my all into learning athletic software engineering. In my opinion, being able to do more in less time will be a boon to my future self, as we will find ourselves with less and less time as other things fill up our shcedule. If I actually want to make and finish games as a side hobby, I need to commit myself to this practice.
