*How do I declare a variable again?*

## Learning TypeScript without knowing Javascript.

Before my ICS 314 class, I did not know any Javascript. I had heard about it from other people in my earlier classes, but I had never experimented with it myself. Thankfully, because I have had to learn other languages like C, C#, and Java, learning the syntax of Javascript wasn't too hard for me. Learning TypeScript was actually easier than I thought after that, as it made more sense to me than Javascript. I am used to having to declare a type for every variable, so learning TypeScript was actually a fun and gratifying experience after that.

## What I think of TypeScript.

I think TypeScript is a good language if you are looking to work in a collaborative setting, like in software engineering. It works better than Javascript for this because it enforces type-setting for variables. This way, if you are passing a function or a variable to another person working on the program, then they can see with a glance what exactly the value should be. This removes the ambiguity from functions that return values. From the perspective of a solo-coder, it might require a bit more work on the syntax side, but it is well worth it due to the scalability of the language.
