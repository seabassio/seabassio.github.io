Broadcast 9 is a personal project of mine that I will work on for a long time. I started it around October 2024, and have taken major inspiration from games like Ace Attorney and Persona 4. 

For this game, my most notable achievements:

- Freeform note-taking system - During interrogations, you have access to your notebook, which you can use to pull questions from and press the person you are interrogation. This system is where the main gameplay of Broadcast 9 lies, as you can also jot down temporary notes, and even combine two that seem to fit together logically and press the suspect on the connection. It's up to the player to find out what fits together with what, and can get challenging sometimes by having to catch the right statement at the right time!

- Flexible dialogue box
- Dynamic in-dialogue screen
